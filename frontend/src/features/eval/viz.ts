/**
 * Chart palette + formatters for the evaluation dashboard (phase-45).
 *
 * These values were **validated, not chosen by eye** — `scripts/validate_palette.js` from the
 * dataviz skill, run against BuildSmith's own chart surface (`#0f172a`, the raised slate token) in
 * dark mode:
 *
 *   accent  `#6366f1`  PASS lightness band · PASS chroma floor · PASS contrast >= 3:1
 *   context `#64748b`  in-band, >= 3:1, and *deliberately* below the chroma floor — it is the
 *                      de-emphasis gray, which is supposed to read gray
 *
 * Two shades of one hue could not span the >=15 normal-vision deltaE floor while staying inside the
 * dark lightness band (0.48–0.67) — that squeeze is structural for a single hue. So the paired
 * chart uses the skill's **emphasis** form instead: the after-value in the accent, the before-value
 * in the de-emphasis gray. That is also the more honest encoding here, because the post-repair
 * number *is* the story and the first-pass number is its context.
