# sandbox

The per-project execution sandbox image where **untrusted generated code runs**. The control plane
never execs generated code directly (§7); it only runs it inside a container built from this image.

## Contents (`Dockerfile`)

- `node:20-bookworm-slim` base, `git` + `curl` + `tini`, and a **baked** pnpm (see below).
- Playwright **chromium** (+ OS deps) pre-installed to `/ms-playwright` (shared, world-readable);
  the `playwright` package lives at `/opt/pw` and is importable via `NODE_PATH` (CommonJS).
- A **`mongod`** (MongoDB 8.0 community, checksum-verified) at `/usr/local/bin/mongod`, for
  generated-app **tests only** (see below).
- Non-root user **`app`** (uid 1000); workspace at **`/workspace`**.
- No secrets are baked in.

`entrypoint.sh` keeps the container alive for the manager to `docker exec` into (filesystem / exec /
preview) and **never auto-runs** untrusted code. `tini` is PID 1 for signal forwarding + zombie
reaping. It also warns loudly if `$HOME` is unwritable, because that failure otherwise surfaces as an
unreadable Node stack trace.

## pnpm is baked, and `$HOME` must be writable

`corepack enable` alone is **not** enough. Corepack downloads the requested pnpm on first use, into
`$HOME/.cache/node/corepack` — and the sandbox has a read-only root *and* no network, so the first
`pnpm` command in the sandbox died with:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/home/app/.cache/node/corepack/v1'
```

Two things fix it, and both are load-bearing:

1. **Here:** `COREPACK_HOME=/opt/corepack` (world-readable, baked at build time) plus
   `corepack prepare pnpm@<PNPM_VERSION> --activate`, so pnpm needs neither a download nor a `$HOME`
   write to start. `PNPM_VERSION` tracks `packageManager` in `templates/app-skeleton/package.json`;
   `COREPACK_ENABLE_STRICT=0` makes a drifted `packageManager` field fall back to the baked pnpm
   instead of failing offline. The build asserts both (as root and as `app`) with
   `COREPACK_ENABLE_NETWORK=0`.
2. **In the manager:** a per-project named volume mounted at `/home/app`, because pnpm/npm still
   write caches and the pnpm store under `$HOME` at *install* time.

## A baked `mongod` for tests (phase-65)

Generated backends test their data layer against a real MongoDB. The usual way to get one,
`mongodb-memory-server`, downloads a ~105 MB `mongod` on **first use**. A test run has no network
(egress windows are only opened for package installs), so the download failed and a model spent its
repair iterations concluding it was *"unable to download mongod due to no network access"*.

So the binary is baked at build time, the only time there is a network, and the library is pointed
at it through its own environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGOMS_SYSTEM_BINARY` | `/usr/local/bin/mongod` | use the baked binary |
| `MONGOMS_VERSION` | `MONGO_VERSION` (8.0.32) | matches the binary: no conflict warning, wiredTiger engine |
| `MONGOMS_RUNTIME_DOWNLOAD` | `false` | never dial out; a missing binary fails fast and clearly |
| `MONGOMS_DISABLE_POSTINSTALL` | `1` | the non-core package never fetches 105 MB inside an install window |

`mongod` binds `127.0.0.1` inside the container. **This adds a binary, not a route**: no network
policy changes. The generated app's skeleton starts one server per Jest run and gives each test file
its own database (`backend/src/test/`, see the skeleton README).

The tarball is chosen by `TARGETARCH`: the Debian 12 build on amd64, and the Ubuntu 22.04 build on
arm64, because MongoDB publishes no arm64 Debian build and bookworm's glibc 2.36 satisfies jammy's 2.35.
It is not copied from the `mongo:8.0` image, which is built on Ubuntu noble (glibc 2.39). To bump,
change `MONGO_VERSION` and both `MONGO_SHA256_*` args together (MongoDB publishes the checksums at
`https://downloads.mongodb.org/current.json`).

## Runtime isolation is the manager's job (phase-11)

This image is intentionally reusable across environments. The hard isolation — **no host network,
dropped capabilities, and CPU / memory / PID limits** — is applied by the sandbox manager at
`docker run` time (phase-11), not baked into the image. So are the two writable mounts
(`/workspace`, `/home/app`) that a read-only root requires.

Each sandbox lives on its **own `internal` docker network** (`BuildSmith-sbnet-<project>`): no route
to the host, no internet, and no other sandbox on it. It is not `network_mode: none`, because docker
refuses to attach any network to a `none`-mode container — which would make the preview proxy
(phase-15) and the registry-egress window for installs (phase-39 / `app/sandbox/network.py`)
impossible. Those are still attached deliberately and temporarily, never at creation.

A sandbox created from an older image (or without the `/home/app` mount) is **recreated** by
`SandboxManager.ensure` on next use — the volumes, and therefore the generated code, survive. Rebuild
with `make sandbox-build`; no manual container surgery needed.

## Build & smoke

```bash
make sandbox-build     # docker build -t $SANDBOX_IMAGE sandbox/
make sandbox-smoke     # build + run the Node app + Playwright chromium check in-container
docker run --rm BuildSmith-sandbox:latest whoami   # -> app
```

`smoke/run_smoke.sh` is CI-invokable (see the `sandbox` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): it builds
the image, asserts it runs as `app`, runs **pnpm under the real runtime posture** (read-only root, no
network, `$HOME` on a volume — the regression check for the corepack `ENOENT` above), asserts the
unwritable-`$HOME` warning is emitted, then starts the sample Node server (`smoke/server.cjs`) and
drives it with a Playwright chromium test (`smoke/browser-check.cjs`), all inside the container.
Two phase-65 steps cover the baked `mongod`: it must start under the same posture (with pids and
memory caps), and `mongodb-memory-server-core`, installed with network and then run **without**,
must start it and round-trip a document (`smoke/mongo-check.cjs`).

## Rollback

`docker rmi BuildSmith-sandbox:latest` and prune build cache. No persistent state.
