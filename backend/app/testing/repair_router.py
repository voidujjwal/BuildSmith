"""Repair API (phase-32 wiring) — drive and read back the bounded repair loop.

The loop itself is phase-31; this is the thin HTTP surface the Test-stage UI needs:

- ``POST /projects/{id}/repair/run`` — run the bounded loop over a failing ``TestRun`` (the latest
  by default). Iterations stream as ``repair.iteration`` events while the request is in flight, and
  the terminal ``repair.done``/``repair.escalation`` arrives with the response.
- ``GET  /projects/{id}/repair/latest`` — the persisted loop report (so a reload doesn't lose the
  escalation payload).
- ``GET  /projects/{id}/repair/attempts/{attempt_id}/diff`` — one attempt's patch, for the diff
  view.
- ``GET  /projects/{id}/repair/export-bob-handoff`` — download a zip for "Continue in IDE":
  AGENTS.md, .bob/rules/BuildSmith-stack.md, and BOB_HANDOFF.md rendered from the escalation data.

Ownership is enforced through the owning project; a record the caller doesn't own is a ``404``, so
its existence is never leaked.
