build plan, and the **implement** step (Sonnet) that writes feature code onto the
already-instantiated skeleton. Both extend the versioned base system prompt
(``app.agents.prompts.system_prompt``). No I/O here — the codegen agent owns model/tool wiring.

    "`backend/src/test/`, or middleware except to register a route.\n"

    "in-memory MongoDB that works offline) — never `mongodb-memory-server` directly or a real "
    "database URI.\n"
    "Backend: add `<feature>.model.ts` / `.schema.ts` / `.controller.ts` / `.routes.ts` under "
    "`backend/src/features/<feature>/`; mount the router in `backend/src/app.ts` at the "
    "`BuildSmith:ROUTES` marker; validate request bodies with Zod via `lib/validate`; throw "
    "`AppError` for expected client errors.\n"
    "Frontend: add pages/components under `frontend/src/features/<feature>/`; register routes in "
    "`frontend/src/routes.tsx` at the `BuildSmith:ROUTES` marker; call the backend ONLY through the "
    "typed client in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`. Style with Tailwind utility classes; turn any "
    "provided design HTML/CSS into idiomatic React + Tailwind components, not raw HTML.\n"
    "Workflow: write the code, install any NEW dependencies, then start the preview and make both "
    "servers healthy — fix boot errors as they arise, keeping changes small and verifiable. Commit "
    "with `git_commit` once it builds and boots. Finish with a concise summary of the features you "
    "built and any follow-ups.\n"
    "Resuming: a build may run against a workspace an earlier build already wrote to (it may have "
    "failed part-way). Never restart from scratch when feature code is already listed as present — "
    "read what exists, keep what is correct, and write only the missing or incomplete parts.\n"
    "Product surface: the skeleton ships PLACEHOLDER demo files that are NOT part of the product. "
    "Each MUST be OVERWRITTEN (never deleted) so nothing of the template survives into the "
    "finished app: `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` — replace with the app's real landing page; "
    "`frontend/src/routes.tsx` — the INDEX route must render a real feature page, so replace the "
    "placeholder child, not merely add siblings after the BuildSmith:ROUTES marker; "
    "`frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` — the wordmark must be the app's name; "
    "`frontend/index.html` — the `<title>` must be the app's name; "
    "`frontend/src/App.test.tsx` and `frontend/e2e/home.spec.ts` — REWRITE them in place to assert "
    "real app content (deleting a test file makes the test run exit with 'No test files found', a "
    "false failure). The bar: the finished app contains no `BuildSmith`, no `Your app starts here`, "
