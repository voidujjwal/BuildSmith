"""Deterministic port reclaim inside the sandbox (phase-59).

The reverse proxy routes ``*.preview.localhost`` to fixed container ports, so *"these two ports are
mine"* is the property a preview restart must guarantee. The previous implementation guaranteed
something weaker and untrue: it killed the PIDs it happened to remember in process memory
(``PreviewService._state``). In dev the control plane runs ``uvicorn --reload``, so **every backend
edit wiped that dict** and orphaned whatever was running inside the sandbox — after which Vite finds
5173 taken, slides to 5175, reports itself healthy, and the proxy serves nothing.

Reclaiming *by port* holds regardless of who started the process or which control-plane process is
alive now. Two mechanisms, in order:

1. ``fuser -k -n tcp <port>`` — precise, needs ``psmisc`` (added to the image in phase-59).
2. A pure ``/proc`` scan — no packages at all, so a container still running the *old* image (they
   outlive the control plane) degrades instead of failing.

Both are followed by a re-scan, because a reclaim that silently did nothing is exactly the failure
this module exists to prevent: the caller needs to know the port is genuinely free before it starts
a dev server that would otherwise slide to another one.

The scripts are built as pure strings so they are unit-testable without a Docker daemon, and they
only ever touch the ports handed to them.
