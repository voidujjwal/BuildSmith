"""Per-project sandbox container lifecycle via the Docker SDK (phase-11).

Responsibilities:
  - map ``Project ↔ container`` (persisted on ``Project.sandbox_id``);
  - create/start/stop/destroy the container with the hard isolation posture applied at
    ``docker run`` time (its own *internal* per-project network — no host network, no internet —
    dropped caps, cpu/mem/pid limits, read-only root with writable ``/workspace`` + ``/home/app``
    named volumes and a ``/tmp`` tmpfs);
  - recreate a container that predates the current image/mount spec, so an image fix actually
    reaches projects that already have a sandbox;
  - reap idle containers after ``sandbox_idle_timeout_s`` and reconcile mappings on startup.

The Docker SDK is synchronous; every blocking call is off-loaded via :func:`asyncio.to_thread`
so the event loop is never blocked. The client is injectable for tests (a fake stands in for
the daemon); in production it is built lazily from the environment.
