"""Recognise failures caused by the sandbox having no network (phase-65).

A sandbox has no internet while generated code runs, builds or is tested — only package installs
borrow a registry route (:mod:`app.sandbox.network`). Code that assumes otherwise fails in ways a
model reads as a puzzle and then re-derives, attempt after attempt: the reported case was a repair
session that ended with the model reasoning it was *"unable to download mongod due to no network
access"*. This module names those failures deterministically so nobody pays to rediscover them.

Two verdicts, deliberately different:

- **not repairable** — the sandbox itself lacks something no patch can supply (the test database's
  ``mongod``). The repair loop stops before spending an attempt (``REASON_ENVIRONMENT``).
- **repairable** — the *code* reached for the network (an external API, a runtime browser
  download). The agent gets a precise hint and fixes the code.

Pure and table-driven, like :mod:`app.agents.build_errors`: substrings are matched
case-insensitively against a failing test's message/stack, most specific first.
