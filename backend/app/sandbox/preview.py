"""Live preview: run the generated app's dev servers inside its sandbox (phase-15).

Starts the skeleton's FE (Vite) and BE (Express) via phase-13 exec, streams their logs as
``terminal.output`` tagged per process, health-polls both, and resolves the proxied URLs.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Health probes run inside the sandbox** (``curl`` against loopback), not from the control
  plane. That keeps the check working regardless of how the sandbox is (or isn't) networked, and
  it needs no host access.
- **Networking** is a deliberate relaxation of phase-11's sealed per-project network: on start the
  sandbox *also* joins a dedicated *internal* docker network (see ``build_preview_network_kwargs``)
  so the reverse proxy can reach the dev servers. Still no host network and no internet.
- **Dependencies** are ensured before the servers launch (:mod:`app.sandbox.deps`) — the skeleton is
  copied in as source only, so without that step there is nothing to run.
