"""Deploy read API (phase-38) — what the topology view hydrates from.

The graph follows live ``deploy.status`` events while a deploy runs, but a reload has no events to
replay, so it hydrates from the last persisted ``Deployment`` instead — which is why these are
read-only:

- ``GET /projects/{id}/deploy/latest`` — the most recent deployment (topology, URLs, status), or
  ``null`` before the first deploy.
- ``GET /projects/{id}/deploy/latest/logs`` — BuildSmith's own **pipeline** log (which database mode
  was chosen, why the frontend was skipped, whether the env mirror landed). Nothing else records
  that, which is why it survives phase-62 rather than being replaced.
- ``GET /projects/{id}/deploy/latest/logs/{target}`` — the **provider's** log for one target
  (phase-62). What "Logs" on a Vercel node ought to have meant all along.
- ``GET /projects/{id}/deploy/config`` — which backend provider is configured, so the UI can name
  the right credential in BYO mode instead of assuming Vercel.

Deploying is *not* here: it runs through the conductor (``POST /projects/{id}/intent`` with
``stage=deploy``), so stage legality — the deploy⇐build hard prereq (§8) — stays enforced in exactly
one place. **Deleting** is here (phase-62): it is not a stage transition the conductor could route,
and it owns resetting the stage itself.

Nothing in these payloads is sensitive: a ``Deployment`` records URLs and topology, never env values
(§7), and a provider log is build output, not configuration.
