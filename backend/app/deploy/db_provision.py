"""Per-project database provisioning + URI injection (phase-36, D8).

Every generated app gets an **isolated database**, and BuildSmith injects its ``MONGODB_URI`` into
the app for both preview (phase-15) and prod (phase-37). Two modes:

- **Platform** — a per-project *database* (``Project.app_db_name``, a globally-unique
  ``BuildSmith_app_<uuid>``) inside the shared app-data cluster. Distinct database per project is the
  strongest isolation available on a shared cluster (D8 design note); MongoDB creates it lazily on
  first write, so "provisioning" is composing the right URI — no admin API call needed. BuildSmith
  *manages* these (may drop on delete).
- **BYO** — a user-supplied ``MONGODB_URI`` from the vault (phase-34). Used verbatim, validated, and
  **never lifecycle-managed** — BuildSmith never creates or drops a database it doesn't own.

The composed URI is a **secret** (it can carry cluster credentials): it is returned only to the
env-injection call sites, never logged and never placed on a client response.
