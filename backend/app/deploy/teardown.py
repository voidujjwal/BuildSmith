"""Deployment teardown (phase-62) — take a deployment down and leave the project honest.

``DeployProvider.destroy`` has existed since phase-35 with no caller: nothing in BuildSmith could
remove a deployment, and deleting a *project* left its deployments live and billing forever. This is
that caller, used by both the explicit "delete deployment" action and the project-delete cascade.

Three properties matter:

- **Fail soft, report loudly.** A revoked token or an already-deleted deployment must not leave the
  user with a record they cannot remove. Each target is attempted independently and whatever could
  not be reclaimed is named in the report, exactly as :class:`~app.projects.service.DeleteReport`
  does for sandboxes and databases.
- **Hosting only, never data.** The app database is untouched. Dropping data stays an explicit
  project-delete opt-in (D8) — taking a site down is not a reason to destroy what it stored.
- **The stage stops claiming a live deployment.** ``validate ⇐ deploy`` is a hard prereq (D12), so
  leaving deploy ``complete`` after a teardown would let live-validation run against a URL that no
  longer resolves. Deploy goes back to ``empty`` and validate — whose evidence now points at a dead
  URL — goes ``stale``.
