"""Stitch design provider (phase-17) — the default, highest-risk design backend (D9/D10).

Wires three concerns behind the provider-agnostic :class:`DesignProvider` contract:

- **Transport** (:class:`StitchClient`): speaks the **Stitch MCP API** — JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP to
  ``https://stitch.googleapis.com/mcp``. :class:`HttpStitchClient` implements the real protocol
  (initialize handshake → ``tools/call``), and stays behind the Protocol so tests inject a fake.
- **Auth** (:class:`~app.design.stitch_auth.StitchAuth`): API key, Google bearer token, or a
  client-credentials exchange — resolved per call into headers.
- **Quota** (:class:`~app.design.stitch_quota.StitchQuota`): pre-check + fail-soft at the cap.

**Capability note:** Stitch's API surface is *text-prompt only* — ``generate_screen_from_text``,
``edit_screens``, ``generate_variants`` and the project/screen reads. Screenshot→UI exists in the
Stitch web app but has no tool on the API, so :meth:`StitchDesignProvider.capabilities` reports
``from_image=False`` and screenshot intake degrades to the next provider in the fallback chain
(phase-48) instead of silently producing a design that ignored the screenshots.

**Conversational replies:** Stitch answers a broad brief with a scope proposal and a question
("shall I proceed with these five screens?") as often as it answers with a design. A proposal only
needs a yes, so :meth:`HttpStitchClient._generate` says it — bounded by
``STITCH_CLARIFY_MAX_REPLIES`` — rather than letting a usable brief collapse onto the figma/fake
fallback. A question that survives that budget wants a decision nobody here can make, so it is
raised as ``clarification`` and the design stage parks it for the user to answer (phase-19,
``app/design/questions.py``).

Failures are classified (auth/quota/transient/fatal/unsupported) as :class:`ProviderError` with a
fallback hint. Missing credentials → ``health()==down`` (never a crash) so the stage falls back.
Keys and tokens are never logged or placed in any :class:`DesignResult`/artifact/event.
