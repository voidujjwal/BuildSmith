"""Automatic design-provider fallback (phase-48, D10 / risk §12).

Design providers are the most failure-prone dependency BuildSmith has — Stitch's monthly generation
quota is a *when*, not an *if*. Earlier phases classified every provider failure as a
:class:`ProviderError` with a ``fallback_hint``; this module turns that hint into action.

Rather than dead-ending, a **generate** call tries the active provider first and then a configured
chain (``figma`` → ``fake`` by default), skipping providers that lack the needed capability, and
reports which provider actually served the request so the stage can tell the user a fallback
happened ("Stitch's quota is exhausted — generated via figma instead").

Two deliberate boundaries:

- **Generation only.** ``refine`` keys off a provider-specific ``external_ref``, so handing it to a
  different provider would fail anyway — refine stays single-provider (its ``fallback_hint`` still
  guides the user to switch). The corollary is :func:`provider_for_refine`: a refine must go to the
  provider that *produced* the design, which after a fallback is **not** the active one.
- **``fatal`` and ``clarification`` never fall back.** A request *we* rejected locally is the
  caller's problem; another provider will reject it too. A ``clarification`` is not a failure at
  all — the provider is waiting on a decision only the user can make, and quietly asking a
  different provider to design something else is exactly the outcome this avoids (it goes to the
  design stage, which parks it: ``app/design/questions.py``). Everything else —
  quota/auth/transient/unsupported/``contract`` (the provider rejected our call or drifted)
  /unknown — advances the chain.
