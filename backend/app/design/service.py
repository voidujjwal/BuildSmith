"""Design results → versioned ``design`` artifacts (phase-16).

The provider-agnostic pipeline the stage handler (phase-19) will drive: pick the active provider,
call it, and persist the result as the next `design` artifact version. Nothing here knows about
Stitch or Figma.

**Payload shape:** phase-07 artifacts carry a single text payload, so HTML+CSS ride together in one
JSON envelope. That keeps a design version atomic (markup and styles can never drift apart across
versions) and inherits phase-07's inline-vs-blob strategy for free — large designs land in the blob
store automatically. Structured fields (provider, external ref, preview image) live in ``meta``, so
a later ``fetch_code``/``refine`` can find the provider's handle without parsing the payload.
