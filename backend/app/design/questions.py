"""Design clarifying questions — parking a provider's question until the user answers it.

A design provider can answer a brief with a question instead of a design ("who is this app for?",
"shall I start with the public feed or the admin tools?"). The Stitch transport confirms a plain
proposal itself, but a real question is a decision, and BuildSmith used to resolve it by failing
over to the next provider — which produced a design nobody asked for, from a brief that was fine.

This module is the other half of that: the question is recorded as a
:class:`~app.db.models.design_question.DesignQuestion`, the stage goes ``awaiting_user``, and the
user's next message is sent back to the provider as the answer. Nothing here is Stitch-specific —
the question arrives as a classified :class:`ProviderError` (``detail["kind"] == "clarification"``)
and any provider that learns to ask one gets this behaviour for free.
