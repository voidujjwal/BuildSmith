"""Tracing & correlation (phase-46, §7/D4).

Phase-20 already accounts for spend on a :class:`~app.db.models.Run`; this module makes that work
*traceable* rather than adding a second accounting system. Two pieces:

**Correlation.** A run's ``project_id`` / ``run_id`` / ``kind`` live in context variables, and a
logging filter stamps them onto every record emitted while that context is active. So a log line
written deep inside a tool call can be tied back to the run that caused it without every call site
having to pass ids around — and a request that touches three subsystems reads as one story.

**One traced unit.** :func:`traced_run` opens a ``Run``, binds the correlation context, times the
work, records its outcome, and always closes it — including when the work raises, because an
un-finished ``Run`` is worse than none: it silently understates spend and leaves a trace that looks
like it is still going.

Redaction lives in ``app/core/logging.py`` and applies to everything here; nothing in this module
logs a value it did not receive as an id.
