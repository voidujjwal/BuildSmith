"""Prometheus exposition for the control plane (devops step 4).

Three rules shape this module:

**It is a read-only observer.** Nothing here changes request handling. The middleware times the
call, records the outcome and returns the response untouched; if recording itself raises, the
request still succeeds. An observability layer that can fail a request is worse than no metrics.

**Labels are bounded by construction.** The single thing that kills a Prometheus install is
unbounded label cardinality, and an HTTP path is the classic source: ``/projects/6712…/artifacts``
would mint a new time series per project. So the ``path`` label is always the *route template*
(``/projects/{project_id}/artifacts``), read from ``scope["route"].path_format`` after routing.
Requests that matched no route -- a scanner walking a public VM -- collapse into one
``<unmatched>`` bucket rather than one series per probed URL.

**Scrape output must never contain a secret.** Only method, route template and status code are
labelled. No query strings, no bodies, no header values, no user or project ids.

The registry is module-local rather than ``prometheus_client.REGISTRY``: a process-global default
registry makes tests order-dependent (duplicate-registration errors on re-import) and would export
whatever any dependency happened to register. Process/platform/GC collectors are attached
explicitly, so the Grafana dashboard still gets RSS, CPU and fd counts.
