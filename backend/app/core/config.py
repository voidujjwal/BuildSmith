"""Layered configuration resolver.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

    1. registered override providers  — phase-51 prepends a DB/admin provider
    2. environment / ``.env``          — via pydantic-settings on ``Settings``
    3. code defaults                   — field defaults on ``Settings``

i.e. precedence is **admin panel (DB) > env > default**, exactly the user directive.

All application code MUST read configuration through :func:`get_config` (never ``os.environ``
directly — enforced by ``infra/scripts/check_no_os_environ.sh``). This module is the single
allowed place to touch the environment.
