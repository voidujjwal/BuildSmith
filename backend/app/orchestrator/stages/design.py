"""Design stage handler (phase-19) — the first real :class:`StageHandler`.

Provider-agnostic (talks only to the active :class:`~app.design.base.DesignProvider`), honoring the
non-linear model (D12). It maps the three UI actions onto the design lifecycle:

- ``refine`` — the workhorse. Depending on the intent payload it **generates** (text / uploaded
  screenshots) or **imports** a bring-your-own design, or (no intake, just an instruction)
  **refines** the latest design via the provider. Always produces a *new* ``design`` version and
  leaves the stage ``awaiting_user`` for review. On a previously-complete stage the conductor's
  refine action also marks downstream stages ``stale``.
- ``proceed`` — **approve** the latest design (→ ``complete``); no provider call.
- ``skip`` — opt out; downstream must tolerate a missing design.

Since requirements moved ahead of design (2026-08-06), a **generate** additionally folds the latest
``RequirementSpec`` into the provider prompt when one exists, so the UI reflects what the app has to
do rather than being drawn from screenshots/text alone. This is a **soft** dependency and stays one:
no prereq, no gate, and with no spec the provider call is byte-for-byte what it was before.

The handler returns an :class:`ArtifactSpec` and lets the **conductor** persist it (single writer),
so the new version is linked to the assistant reply and returned in the intent response. Provider
failures (quota/auth) propagate as :class:`ProviderError` with a ``fallback_hint`` — a clear message
+ fallback, never a crash.
