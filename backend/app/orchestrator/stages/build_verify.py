"""Build verification & bounded self-heal (phase-55 task 12).

After codegen writes the app this proves it actually works — **install → typecheck → boot →
placeholder check → feature-code check** — and self-heals what is broken through the *existing*
bounded repair loop (phase-31), reused via its Build parameters rather than a second loop (D7 /
Golden Rule 5).

The feature-code check (phase-64) is *structural*: the string-only placeholder gate was satisfied
by a build that wrote no feature code at all and then re-worded the template ("My App", "Welcome to
the app."). Its findings never reach the repair loop — missing code is not a patch.

The discipline the user asked for is structural, not a policy the loop is trusted to follow: every
step's failure is **classified before** any synthetic ``TestRun`` is built (:mod:`app.agents.
build_errors`). An ``environment`` / ``provider`` / ``budget`` verdict returns immediately with a
``stop_reason`` and an actionable hint — **zero** repair iterations, **zero** model tokens. Only a
``code`` verdict is adapted into synthetic results and forwarded to the loop.

Every collaborator is injected (mirroring :class:`~app.orchestrator.stages.validate.
LiveValidationController`), so the whole flow is exercised without Docker, a model, or a provider.
