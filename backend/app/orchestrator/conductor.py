"""The Conductor (phase-08): the single owner of transition legality and intent routing (§8).

Flow for one intent:

1. Resolve ownership; snapshot stage statuses.
2. Map the intent's UI action → a state-machine action and **reject illegal transitions before
   any side effect** (``UserError``).
3. Persist the inbound user message.
4. Open a ``Run`` (cost hook; zero cost for stubs, real accrual lands in phase-20).
5. Dispatch to the stage handler; persist its messages + versioned artifacts.
6. Apply the state transition (phase-06) — which also emits ``stage.transition`` (phase-05).
7. Close the ``Run``.

Intent → state-machine action mapping:
  - ``skip``     → ``skip``
  - ``unskip``   → ``unskip`` (restore the status the stage held before it was skipped)
  - ``proceed``  → ``complete`` (accept the stage and advance; honors the hard prereqs)
  - ``refine``   → ``refine`` if the stage is already complete/skipped/stale (a jump-back that
                   stales downstream), else ``enter`` (start/continue an in-flight stage).

``unskip`` is answered by step 6 alone — it is a pure state restore, so no stage handler runs and
no artifact is produced (step 5 is skipped entirely).
