"""Taking a deployment down (phase-62).

``destroy`` existed on every adapter since phase-35 with no caller, so nothing — not even deleting
the whole project — could take a deployment down: it kept serving, and billing, with nothing in
BuildSmith left pointing at it.

Three properties are load-bearing and each has a test here: the record is retired even when a
provider refuses, the stage state stops claiming a live deployment, and the app database is never
touched.
