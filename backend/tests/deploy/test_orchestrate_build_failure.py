"""A frontend that fails to *build* must degrade the deploy, not abandon it.

The SPA is compiled inside BuildSmith's own sandbox, so a broken build surfaces as a ``UserError``
from the frontend builder — not as the ``ProviderError`` the orchestrator used to catch. Escaping
that ``except`` abandoned the whole deploy: the backend was already live (and billed), the database
already provisioned, and no ``Deployment`` was written to record either. The user saw one sentence
("that didn't go through") and the topology kept showing the state before the attempt.

The same applies to a plan with no frontend at all. That is legal — a backend-only project deploys
fine — but it must be *said*, because the only other evidence is a node quietly missing from the
graph, which reads as a rendering bug rather than as a decision the analyzer made.
