"""Hero-demo smoke test (phase-50) — a headless rehearsal that guards the money moment.

The demo's thesis (D1) is the bounded repair loop turning a build that *almost* works into one that
does. This drives the **real** hero spec through the **real** headless runner, with only the costly
legs (model, sandbox, live deploy) injected as fakes, and asserts each milestone the runbook
promises: the skeleton is instantiated, a genuine first-pass failure is then repair-fixed, the
deploy is healthy, live validation runs, and a final URL comes out. It is the regression guard that
catches a broken hero path before a live audience does.
