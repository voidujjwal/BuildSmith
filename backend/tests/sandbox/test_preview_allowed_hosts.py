"""The FE dev server must accept the hostnames the preview proxy actually uses.

Vite >= 5.4.12 answers **403** to a `Host` header it does not recognise, and Caddy forwards the
original host. `*.localhost` is allowed by Vite itself (which is why local preview survives), but a
real `PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN` is not — so the platform passes the allowlist to the skeleton's
vite.config via `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Verified against a real dev server: an allowlisted host gets
200, an unlisted one still gets 403.
