"""A sandbox that predates the current image/mount spec must be rebuilt, not adopted.

Sandboxes are long-lived: the container is created once and reused for the life of the project. That
made an *image* fix unreachable — the sandbox that could not run `pnpm` (no writable $HOME, no baked
corepack) would keep failing forever, because `ensure` only ever started what was already there. So
`ensure` now replaces a container whose mounts or image no longer match, and the code survives
because it lives on the named volumes rather than in the container.
