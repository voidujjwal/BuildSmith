"""A preview whose URLs cannot possibly load must say so, not report a healthy "running".

`*.preview.localhost` is served by the Caddy proxy and by nothing else. Run the API on the host
without the compose stack (a normal way to develop here) and the dev servers come up perfectly
inside the sandbox while the browser gets `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` — an error that points at the
generated app, which is the last place the problem actually is.
