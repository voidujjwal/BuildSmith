"""Each BuildSmith project designs into its **own** provider container.

The registry hands out a single :class:`StitchDesignProvider` for the whole process (phase-16), and
the Stitch client used to cache "the last project I created" on that shared instance. Every
BuildSmith project therefore inherited one Stitch project: a brand-new project opened showing the
*previous* project's screens in the picker — before its owner had designed anything — and a
generate added to that same stranger's Stitch project.

These pin the fix: the container is resolved from the project's **own** latest design, so a project
with no design yet gets a fresh one (and an empty picker), and successive turns keep building the
same app.
