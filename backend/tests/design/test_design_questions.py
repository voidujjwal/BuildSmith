"""A design provider's clarifying question, put to the user instead of failed over.

The live failure this covers: Stitch answered a perfectly good brief with "I propose a 5-screen
experience … shall I proceed?", BuildSmith classified that as a provider failure, and the design
stage served a placeholder from the `fake` fallback. A question is not a failure — it stops the
chain, is parked as a `DesignQuestion`, and the user's next message answers it.

Driven end-to-end through the conductor with scripted providers, so the intent the UI actually
sends is what is exercised.
