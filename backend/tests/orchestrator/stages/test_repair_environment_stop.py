"""A failure the sandbox causes stops the loop before any attempt (phase-65).

The reported session: a model spent its repair attempts discovering, and re-discovering, that it
could not download a ``mongod`` because the sandbox has no network. No patch can supply a binary
the image lacks, so the loop now recognises it from the context and escalates at zero iterations —
no attempt, no ``MODEL_CODEGEN`` tokens — saying what does fix it. A *repairable* offline finding
(a test calling the internet) must not trigger this: the agent can fix that, and is told how.
